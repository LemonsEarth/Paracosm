Paracosm is a content mod that adds new bosses, weapons, accessories and structures to the game.

Currently adds:

- 2 Hardmode Bosses
- 26 Weapons
- 2 Armor Sets
- 8 Accessories
- 5 Structures
- 1 new minibiome

Paracosm doesn't add much QoL, so I recommend using some like Recipe Browser and Boss Checklist

The mod was designed with multiplayer and other mods in mind, but there may still be bugs, so please report them.

Update v0.5.6:

World Gen:
	- Structures now check structure map to hopefully reduce the chance of overlap
	- Removed small Paracosmic Distortion Cores
	- More Abandoned Armories now generate around the world

NPC Tweaks:
	- Chainsaw Gun and Corrupt Staff are now sold by the Merchant after defeating any evil biome boss
	- Adjusted The Nameless stats so phase 1 is a bit shorter

Item Tweaks:
	- Reworked Voidcore Staff
		- Left click fires homing projectile that charges the weapon on hit
		- With enough charge, press right click to fire bursts of Void Bolts
	- Reduced Chainsaw Gun damage (24 -> 20) and projectile size
	- Reduced Corrupt Staff damage (24 -> 11) and projectile pierce (3 -> 2), reduced projectile hit cooldown (30 -> 15)
	- Devourer Rift now properly displays in the user's hands
	- Round Shield and Roller Shield knockback immunity is disabled for 20 seconds when you get hit
	- Lemon Head costs more lemons, reduced defense increase (7 -> 1), grants Well Fed on use
	- Cat Hat defense reduced (7 -> 1), costs more Flinx Fur and increases summon damage by 5%

Other:
	- Paracosmic Distortion biome is now only active when the player is in front of an Unsafe Parastone Wall, which prevents enemies attacking you outside of the biome

- Fixes:
	- Demon Coins now correctly craft a Star Cloak instead of a Star Veil
